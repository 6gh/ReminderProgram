## What is this?

This is a Reminder program for Windows in which you set reminders for yourself and start it. Then at the set times and dates, a notification pop-up will show up and give you your reminder.

> Note: This simple program was my first Windows Application I ever made and the first release (v3) was my first time ever using c#. Versions 1 and 2 were made in python, and are not available for download.

## Who is this for?

This program was primarily to help me get reminded of things I needed to do, but often forget because I was playing video games. So that sort of answers the question. This program is for anyone that needs help in being reminded of doing something important while you were watching videos, playing games or literally anything on your PC.

## Features

I have tried to code in a lot of features into this program and so far it has:

* The ability to export and import your settings (reminders)
* The ability to automatically start on startup (when you turn on your PC)
* The ability to choose what day and time you should be reminded, up to 1/1/2031
* The ability for the reminders to be repeated yearly, monthly, weekly, daily, or just one time.
* And the ability to have your own custom title and text for your reminder
